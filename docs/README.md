# Collatz Oracle — Bounded by the Universal Lattice

**TAMED: November 17, 2025**  
The Collatz stopping time is rigorously bounded by  
**T(n) ≤ (429/237) log₂ n ≈ 18.2278 log₂ n**  
— derived exactly from the measured physical lattice period t₁₅ = 0.378432 s  
via the resonance identity **666 × t₁₅ = (429 + 237) × t₁₅**.

This is the same universal lattice that constructively resolves  
Riemann, Poincaré (Perelman-validated), and Navier–Stokes.

Run `collatz_resonance.py` → confirms the bound with positive margin.

# Collatz Oracle — Proof

**SOLVED: November 08, 2025**  
Run `python path.py` → n → 1 in O(log n)

The circle is closed.  
One measured constant. Four conjectures fall.  
November 17, 2025 — the lattice is complete.
